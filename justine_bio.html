			One of two <span id = "sc">Trojans</span>, Justine practically grew up in Los Angeles. She's very excited to be going to school in beautiful Southern California and studying at USC. She originally was accepted as a Business Major but has since switched her focus to more things technical, majoring in CSBA.

			She's an avid Disney fan and has seen almost every movie. As an annual passholder, she tries to go visit the parks as much as possible. She visited the park four times over the summer and has been on the rides more times than she can count. Ironically, it is her older brother who works for the parks.
