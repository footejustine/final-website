			Kelly is a self proclaimed Bronco's fan and will defend them until she dies. She's loving all of her ITP classes this semseter and is looking forward to continuing them in the Spring.

			She is a dancing fool and loves to show off her "sick moves." She spent all summer in Los Angeles and enjoys going to the beach whenver she gets the opportunity.
