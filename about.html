		<div id = "info">  In the craziness of college it becomes easy for roommates to lose track of one another and for parents to not know what their children are upto. This is designed as a way for friends and family to know what the girls of 334 are doing this semester and next. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
		All four girls are currently sophomores who all met their freshman year. Although they're all from different places and have different interests, it's easy for them to get along and always have fun together.
